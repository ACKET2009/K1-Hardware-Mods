# D3D K1 XY Joint V3.3 "Updated"

## NOTE:
YOU NEED TO REPRINT XY joint V3.3DD both right and left STL files since V3.1 had some tolerances issues .

# D3D K1 XY Joint V3.1

**This is a work in progress.**


To see how this was made and used, please watch the following video:

This design was made to change the idlers in the K1 to a 6mm x 4mm bore or keep the original ones. For the idlers, we removed the pins and installed BHCS or SHCS M4x20mm... 18mm can also be used.

(Note in the setup shown above, we used M4x20 grub screws instead of a SHCS or BHCS) For the X axis rods, I used M5x5mm grub screws.
