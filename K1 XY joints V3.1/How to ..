The design was made to change the Idlers in the K1 to a 6mm x 4mm Bore or keep the same original ones
For the Idlers i removed the pins and installed BHCS or SHCS M4x20mm ... 18mm also could be used 
(Note in my setup i decided to use M4x20 Grub screws instead of a SHCS or BHCS )
For the X axis rods i used Grub screw M5x5mm

Please feel free to share any modes , i can add them here to refine this Make for the community.
